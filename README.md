The code is not complete (still need cleaning and caan be much faster)

In this project, I employ simulation techniques to model the outcomes of a company or an investor's investment strategies. However, unlike conventional simulations that assume a predictable environment, I embrace randomness and use a Monte Carlo simulation that generates 200,000 paths (or any desired value), each representing a unique sequence of transactions, trades, or decisions.

To reflect the unpredictability of the real-world, I introduce random events into each path. The simulation provides measures of the probability of achieving above or below-average equity, and I emphasize the importance of supplementing models with stress testing and scenario analysis.

By utilizing parameters such as initial equity amount, loss percentage, win percentage, and win rate, the model can generate plots that display minimum, maximum, and average equity values. The code uses Python and scientific computing libraries to create a more accurate representation of the potential outcomes for the company or investor.

Through this simulation, I gain a deeper understanding of the range of possible outcomes and the likelihood of achieving above or below-average equity. 

Hopefully with this modest simulation, we can recognize the importance of asymmetric payoffs for companies to make sure they are protected from the unlucky path. 

Ultimately, my project demonstrates the power of embracing uncertainty and incorporating it into any analysis.
